          <p><STRONG>Are you trying to save money </STRONG>for the big day &#9786; or a rainy day &#9785;, or maybe the day that you can buy your new computer or go on holiday? Setting savings goals is easy, but following the path to reach them can be hard. </p>
          <p>There are so many distractions and temptations along the way. Another latte won’t hurt and uh, those shoes are on sale! Well, it can all add up and while we won’t stop you from enjoying your little treats we can help you to keep an eye on them and stay on the right path to reach your savings goals.</p>
          <p><strong>First, </strong>decide <strong>how much </strong>you want to save and by <strong>when?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Second, </strong>MU Finical Planner will <strong>calculate how much you need </strong>to put aside each month to reach your goal.</p>
          <p><strong>Finally, </strong>MU will tell you how much is <strong>csafe to spend </strong>and whether you are on target for the month.</p>
          <p>MU will also look at your spending by category and let you know if you are spending more than in previous months, to help you stay on track.</p>


          <p><strong>You are likely to overspend on birthdays or holidays? </strong>No problem, just adjust the forecasted spending for that month and MU will calculate the rest.</p>
          <p><strong>Want to save for a rainy day? </strong>No particular amount or target date in mind? You can still use MU to track your progress.</p>
          <p>Would you rather move the amount you need to save into a separate account so you aren’t tempted spend it? Use the MU Blog to find the right savings account or investment opportunity for you and link it all up via MU, so your money gets transferred automatically.</p>

          <p>Is your wallet overflowing with Loyalty Scheme cards? And then it turns out you took out the card for this coffee shop last week! It can be annoying having to carry around a bunch of cards and even more annoying to miss out on collecting the points for your purchases. And even if you have the right card at the right time, there is the time you waste in the queue, having to fish out and swipe you card.</p>
          <p><STRONG>Couldn’t it all just be a little simpler? </STRONG>At MU we think so and with our loyalty scheme aggregator that’s just what we want to do.</p>
          <p><strong>So how does it work? </strong>Let’s say you sign up to a new loyalty program. The merchant will provide you with a loyalty card… but don’t worry about that! Instead you use the MU loyalty system to link your MU card to the new loyalty scheme. And not just one loyalty scheme, as many as you want.</p>
          <p>Next time you are at the merchant, just pay with your MU card and your loyalty schemes will automatically be credited.</p>
          <p>Want to use the points you have accumulated? No problem, your MU card is also linked to the loyalty scheme, so you can ask to redeem your points at any time.</p>
          <p>BAM!</p>
          <p>No more clutter in your wallet, no more forgotten points, no more hassle &#9786;.</p>
